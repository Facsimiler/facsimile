Rich animation point.

A _rich_ animation point is formed from pairing a point in 3D animation space
with a texture map coordinate. This allows faces defined from rich points to
automate texture mapping of images.

@constructor Construct a _rich_ point from a 3D animation space point and an
associated texture point.

@param point Point in 3D in animation space.

@param texturePoint Texture map point.
