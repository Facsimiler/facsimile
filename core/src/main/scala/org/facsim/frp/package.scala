/**
''Functional Reactive Programming'' (''FRP'') package.

@note The elements in this package are ''Scala'' ports of the
''[[https://github.com/SodiumFRP/sodium Sodium FRP Java API]]'', which was
developed by Stephen Blackheath, Anthony Jones and others. While a true
''Scala'' port of this code, some refactoring has also taken place. In
particular, note that the elements in this package are unrelated to the
"official" ''Scala'' port of ''Sodium'', which was created by Mark Butler. In
addition, some class names have also been modified; for instance, the
''Sodium'' `Cell` class has here been renamed to [[org.facsim.frp.Property]],
while the ''Sodium'' `Stream` class is here called
[[org.facsim.frp.EventStream]]. Furthermore, additional simulation-related
features have been added to the API.
